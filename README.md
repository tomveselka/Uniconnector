## Uniconnector

### What is it?
Project to increase my knowledge of REST and SOAP by connecting to three government systems:
-Stolen Documents database
-Insolvency Register ("ISIR")
-Register of economic subjects ("ARES")

### What does it do
Connector contains REST endpoint which can be called with parameters (IÄŒO or Birthnumber) you wish to check. Connector will then handle calling databases and processing answer and give you back abbreviated result
